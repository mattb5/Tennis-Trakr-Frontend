Succinctly put, this app allows a user to log-in to his account and retrieve his personal tennis match history statistics.  The user can also add new matches to this history as well as delete matches and update matches with new information.

The app's backend github repo can be found here : https://github.com/mattb5/Tennis-Trakr-Backend

User stories for my app include 
- as a user, I want to be able to retrieve just MY personal tennis match history.  
- as a user, I want to be able to add new matches to my tennis match history.
- as a user, I want a password-protected account so that only I can see my tennis match history (I lose a lot of matches, so I don't want   to let others see my losing streaks).
- as a user, I want simplicity in design so that I don't need to search hard and long to find my match history.
